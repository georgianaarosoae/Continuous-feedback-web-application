Continuous Feedback Web Application

This web application enables users to provide continuous feedback to a course or tutorial in real-time. Professors can define activities, while students can participate in them using unique access codes.
The feedback system consists of emoticons representing different reactions to the activity, which students can select at any time during the activity's duration.
Professors can view the continuous feedback stream, which is anonymized, both during and after the activity.
